# Scratchpad

A place to record some project notes that should not get lost too easily, but that:

* do not (yet) have a good place to be put permanently
* need to be seriously cleaned up to be put in official places
* are references to be used during the stage of development
* information that might be used, maybe much later
</br></br>

* Using CSS to create the slide show control icon/graphics
  * [How to make complex icons with only CSS](https://blog.truthlabs.com/how-to-make-complex-icons-with-only-css-e135e6dc2c5e)
* [vertical centring](https://codepen.io/chriscoyier/pen/lpema)

* configuring navigation controls to be referenced by navigation targets
  * part of the optional configuration for the slide show
  * image, text, class
  * «extra» properties for navigation controls to be referenced by `data-«back¦forward»-control` references
